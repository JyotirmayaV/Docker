I was unaware of the world of Dockers unless few days before I did a training of Docker under the guidance of world record holder , Vimal Daga Sir.Teaching from the base , he has guided us the details of the architecture and working of docker in such a unique way that it has become a learning for the lifetime.Thanks a lot Sir .THis is my first ever Docker Project from the many which are about to come.
In this , I have used JOOMLA in one docker container and connected it to MYSQL database in another container.Now the client can access the JOOMLA running inside the container launching within seconds.Another benefit is I have also created a compose file as taught by Sir.Now , just by using this .yml file the setup which I have explained above shall be done automatically with no manual labour involved.
